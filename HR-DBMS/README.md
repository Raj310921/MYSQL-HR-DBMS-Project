# TechVision Company Database Project

## Description
This project is based on a sample company database designed to demonstrate the structure and functionality of a typical company database.
It includes sample data and SQL scripts for creating tables, populating data, and running queries.

## Database Schema
The database schema consists of multiple tables representing different entities within the company, such as employees, salaries, employee benefits, and yearly performance reviews.
The relationships between these tables are defined to showcase the data associations and constraints.
A visual representation of the schema can be found in the path 'Images/DB Schema.png'.

## Sample Data
The sample data provided in this project is fictional and was created for demonstration purposes.
It includes a variety of employees, salary, benefits, and performance reviews to showcase different aspects of the database.
All data can be found in CSV file format under 'CSV-Files' folder .

## SQL Scripts
To set up the project and populate the database with sample data, follow these steps:
1. Create a new database in your preferred database management system (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
2. Execute the SQL script `create_tables.sql` to create the necessary tables.
3. Import the CSV files to your respective tables.

## Dependencies
This project requires a database management system i.e. 'MySQL' to run.
Please make sure you have the appropriate software installed before proceeding.

## Usage Instructions
Once the database is set up and populated with data, you can perform various operations such as querying the data, retrieving employee information, and generating reports.
The files under 'SQL-Queries' folder provides some sample SQL queries that you can run to explore the database and retrieve useful information.
